If you need a feature chances are others need it too

The Process goes:
1. Fork it ( https://github.com/[my-github-username]/push_bot/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
